# Shared Task Notes

## What was added
- `/fortune` endpoint that returns a random developer-themed fortune cookie message as JSON

## To test
```bash
npm start
# Then visit http://localhost:3000/fortune
```

## Project status
This simple webserver now has two endpoints:
- `GET /` - Hello World
- `GET /fortune` - Random fortune

The feature is complete and ready for use.
